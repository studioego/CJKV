#
#	Format information:
#
#	Each line of this file consists of three tab-separated fields.
#	The first is the Unicode scalar value as U+[x]xxxx (that is, there are
#		either four or five hex digits)
#	The second is a tag indicating the type of information in the third field
#	The third is the line's value (in UTF-8)
#
#	We give below a list of the tags in alphabetical order.  For each tag,
#	we give additional information, such as its formal status in the standard, 
#	a general category to which its data belongs, the separator (if any) 
#	between individual subvalues, a regular expression indicating the 
#	format of each subvalue, the version of Unicode in which the data were 
#	originally introduced, and a description of the data associated with the 
#	tag.
#
#	Regular expressions are based on standard Perl 5.8.6 syntax and may
#	require modification for use with other regular expression engines.  
#
#	Unless otherwise noted, the order of subvalues within a single
#	value field is not significant.
#
#	Note that only the description is present for every tag value.

#
#	The value of the character when used in the writing of accounting 
#	numerals. 
#	
#	Accounting numerals are used in East Asia to prevent fraud. Because 
#	a number like ten (十) is easily turned into one thousand (千) with 
#	a stroke of a brush, monetary documents will often use an 
#	accounting form of the numeral ten (such as 拾) in their place. 
#	
#	The three numeric-value fields should have no overlap; that is, characters 
#	with a kAccountingNumeric value should not have a kPrimaryNumeric 
#	or kOtherNumeric value as well.

#	The Cantonese pronunciation(s) for this character using the 
#	jyutping romanization. 
#	
#	A full description of jyutping can be found at <http://cpct92.cityu.edu.hk/lshk/Jyutping/Jyutping.htm>. 
#	The main differences between jyutping and the Yale romanization 
#	previously used are: 
#	
#	1) Jyutping always uses tone numbers and does not distinguish 
#	the high falling and high level tones. 
#	
#	2) Jyutping always writes a long a as "aa". 
#	
#	3) Jyutping uses "oe" and "eo" for the Yale "eu" vowel. 
#	
#	4) Jyutping uses "c" instead of "ch", "z" instead of "j", 
#	and "j" instead of "y" as initials. 
#	
#	5) A non-null initial is always explicitly written (thus 
#	"jyut" in jyutping instead of Yale's "yut"). 
#	
#	Cantonese pronunciations are sorted alphabetically, not in 
#	order of frequency. 
#	
#	N.B., the Hong Kong dialect of Cantonese is in the process of dropping 
#	initial NG- before non-null finals. Any word with an initial NG- 
#	may actually be pronounced without it, depending on the speaker and 
#	circumstances. Many words with a null initial may similarly be pronounced 
#	with an initial NG-. Similarly, many speakers use an initial 
#	L- for words previously pronounced with an initial N-.

#	Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1979. 
#	
#	The data here consists of a decimal number followed by a letter A 
#	through K, the letter P, or an asterisk. The decimal number gives 
#	the Soothill number for the character's phonetic, and the letter 
#	is a rough frequency indication, with A indicating the 500 
#	most common ideographs, B the next five hundred, and so on. 
#	
#	P is used by Fenn to indicate a rare character included in 
#	the dictionary only because it is the phonetic element in 
#	other characters. 
#	
#	An asterisk is used instead of a letter in the final position to 
#	indicate a character which belongs to one of Soothill's phonetic

#	The four-corner system assigns each character a four-digit code from

#	The four-corner system is now used only rarely. Full descriptions 
#	are available online, e.g., at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_corner_input>.

#	
#	All 55817 HDZ references in this data set are unique. Because of 
#	IRG source-internal unifications, a given UCS-4 Scalar Value (USV) 
#	may have more than one HDZ reference. Source-internal unifications 
#	are of two types: (1) unifications of graphical variants;

#	
#	The proofing of all references was done primarily on the basis of

#	print source; (2) the "kIRGHanyuDaZidian" field of Unihan.txt (release 
#	3.1.1d1); (3) "HDZ.txt", originally produced and proofed for Academia 
#	Sinica's Institute of Information Technology (Document Processing 
#	Laboratory). In addition, the data was checked against the "kHanYu" 
#	and "kAlternateHanYu" fields of Unihan.txt (release 3.1.1d1), 
#	which the present data set supersedes. 
#	
#	String value, string length, compound key, field count, and page 
#	total validations were all performed. Altogether, 578 omissions/ 
#	errors in source (2) were identified/corrected. Any remaining errors 
#	will likely relate to virtual positions, or to the ordering of actual 
#	characters within a given page. It is unlikely that errors across 
#	page breaks remain. Possible future deunifications of source-internal 
#	unifications will necessitate update of USV for some references. 
#	Under no circumstances should the source-internal unification 
#	(duplicate USV) mappings be removed from this data set. 
#	
#	Note: Source (3) contributed only actual HDZ character references 
#	to the proofing process, while source (2) contributed all virtual 
#	positions. It seems that the compilers of source (2) usually assigned 
#	virtual positions based on stroke count, though occasionally the 
#	virtual position brings the virtual character together with the 
#	actual HDZ character of which it is a variant, without regard 
#	to actual stroke count.

#	The Pronunciations and Frequencies of this character, based in part 
#	on those appearing in 《現代漢語頻率詞典》 <Xiandai Hanyu Pinlu Cidian> (XDHYPLCD) 
#	[Modern Standard Beijing Chinese Frequency Dictionary] (complete 
#	bibliographic information below). 
#	
#	Data Format 
#	
#	This dataset contains a total of 3800 records. Each entry 
#	is comprised of two pieces of data. 
#	
#	The Hanyu Pinyin (HYPY) pronunciation(s) of the character, with numeric 
#	tone marks (1-5, where 5 indicates the "neutral tone") immediately 
#	following each alphabetic string. 
#	
#	Immediately following the numeric tone mark, a numeric string appears 
#	in parentheses: e.g. in "a1(392)" the numeric string "392" indicates 
#	the sum total of the frequencies of the pronunciations of 
#	the character as given in HYPLCD. 
#	
#	Where more than one pronunciation exists, these are sorted 
#	by descending frequency, and the list elements are "comma 
#	+ space" delimited. 
#	
#	Release Information 
#	
#	The XDHYPLCD data here for Modern Standard Chinese (Putonghua) cuts 
#	across 4 genres ("News," "Scientific," "Colloquial," and "Literature"), 
#	and was derived from a 440799 character corpus. See that 
#	text for additional information. 
#	
#	The 8548 entries (8586 with variant writings) from p. 491-656 of 
#	XDHYPLCD were input by hand and proof-read from 1994/08/04 
#	to 1995/03/22 by Richard Cook. 
#	
#	Current Release Date above reflects date of last proofing. 
#	
#	HYPY transcription for the data in this release was semiautomated 
#	and hand-corrected in 1995, based in part on data provided 
#	by Ross Paterson (Department of Computing, Imperial College, 
#	London). 
#	
#	Tom Bishop <http://www.wenlin.com> is also due thanks for 
#	early assistance in proof-reading this data. 
#	
#	The character set used for this digitization of HYPLCD (a 
#	"simplified" mainland PRC text) was (Mac OS 7-9) GB 2312-80 
#	(plus 嗐). 
#	
#	These data were converted to Big5 (plus 腈), and both GB and Big5 
#	versions were separately converted to Unicode 4.0, and then merged, 
#	resulting in the 3800 records in the current release. Frequency data 
#	for simplified polysyllabic words has been employed to generate 
#	both simplified and traditional character frequencies.

#	Introduced:	4.1
#
#	Information on the glyphs in Adobe-Japan1-6 as contributed by Adobe. 
#	The value consists of a number of space-separated entries. 
#	Each entry consists of three pieces of information separated 
#	by a plus sign: 
#	
#	1) C or V. "C" indicates that the Unicode code point maps directly 
#	to the Adobe-Japan1-6 CID that appears after it, and "V" 
#	indicates that it is considered a variant form, and thus 
#	not directly encoded. 
#	
#	2) The Adobe-Japan1-6 CID. 
#	
#	3) Radical-stroke data for the indicated Adobe-Japan1-6 CID. The 
#	radical-stroke data consists of three pieces separated by periods: 
#	the KangXi radical (1-214), the number of strokes in the form the 
#	radical takes in the glyph, and the number of strokes in the residue. 
#	The standard Unicode radical-stroke form can be obtained by omitting 
#	the second value, and the total strokes in the glyph from 
#	adding the second and third values.

#
#	The position of this character in the Song Ben Guang Yun (SBGY) 
#	Medieval Chinese character dictionary (bibliographic and 
#	general information below). 
#	
#	The 25334 character references are given in the form "ABC.XY", in 
#	which: "ABC" is the zero-padded page number [004..546]; "XY" is the 
#	zero-padded number of the character on the page [01..73]. For example, 
#	364.38 indicates the 38th character on Page 364 (i.e. 澍). Where a 
#	given Unicode Scalar Value (USV) has more than one reference, 
#	these are space-delimited. 
#	
#	- Release information (20031005): 
#	
#	This release corrects several mappings. 
#	
#	-- Release information (20020310) -- 
#	
#	This data set contains a total of 25334 references, for 19572 
#	different hanzi (up from 25330 and 19511 in the previous 
#	release). 
#	
#	This release of the kSBGY data fixes a number of mappings, based 
#	on extensive work done since the initial release (compare the initial 
#	release counts given below). See the end of this header for 
#	additional information. 
#	
#	-- Initial release information (20020310) -- 
#	
#	The original data was input under the direction of Prof. LUO Fengzhu 
#	at Taiwan Taoyuanxian Yuan Zhi University (see below) using an early 
#	version of the Big5- based CDP encoding scheme developed at Academia 
#	Sinica. During 2000-2002 this raw data was processed and revised 
#	by Richard Cook as follows: the data was converted to Unicode encoding 
#	using his revised kHanYu mapping tables (first provided to the Unicode 
#	Consortium for the Unihan.txt release 3.1.1d1) and also using several 
#	other mapping tables developed specifically for this project; the 
#	kSBGY indices were generated based on hand-counts of all page 
#	totals; numerous indexing errors were corrected; and the 
#	data underwent final proofing. 
#	
#	-- About the print sources -- 
#	
#	The SBGY text, which dates to the beginning of the Song Dynasty (c. 
#	1008, edited by 陳彭年 CHEN Pengnian et al.) is an enlargement of an 
#	earlier text known as 《切韻》 Qie Yun (dated to c. 601, edited by 陸法言 
#	LU Fayan). With 25,330 head entries, this large early lexicon is 
#	important in part for the information which it provides for historical 
#	Chinese phonology. The GY dictionary employs a Chinese transcription 
#	method (known as 反切) to give pronunciations for each of its 
#	head entries. In addition, each syllable is also given a 
#	brief gloss. 
#	
#	It must be emphasized that the mapping of a particular SBGY glyph 
#	to a single USV may in some cases be merely an approximation or may 
#	have required the choice of a "best possible glyph" (out of those 
#	available in the Unicode repertoire). This indexing data in conjunction 
#	with the print sources will be useful for evaluating the degree of 
#	distinctive variation in the character forms appearing in this text, 
#	and future proofing of this data may reveal additional Chinese 
#	glyphs for IRG encoding.

#	Syntax:	U+2?[0-9A-F]{4}(<k[A-Za-z:]+(,k[A-Za-z]+)*)?
#
#	The Unicode value for a semantic variant for this character. A semantic 
#	variant is an x- or y-variant with similar or identical meaning 
#	which can generally be used in place of the indicated character. 
#	
#	The basic syntax is a Unicode scalar value. It may optionally be 
#	followed by additional data. The additional data is separated from 
#	the Unicode scalar value by a less-than sign (<), and may be subdivided 
#	itself into substrings by commas, each of which may be divided into 
#	two pieces by a colon. The additional data consists of a series of 
#	field tags for another field in the Unihan database indicating the 
#	source of the information. If subdivided, the final piece is a string 
#	consisting of the letters T (for tòng, U+540C 同) B (for bù, 
#	U+4E0D 不), or Z (for zhèng, U+6B63 正). 
#	
#	T is used if the indicated source explicitly indicates the 
#	two are the same (e.g., by saying that the one character 
#	is "the same as" the other). 
#	
#	B is used if the source explicitly indicates that the two 
#	are used improperly one for the other. 
#	
#	Z is used if the source explicitly indicates that the given character 
#	is the preferred form. Thus, the Hanyu Da Zidian indicates that 
#	U+5231 刱 and U+5275 創 are semantic variants and that U+5275 
#	創 is the preferred form.

#
#	RELEASE NOTES:
#
#	5.0		The kCheungBauer, kCheungBauerIndex, kFourCornerCode, and kHangul fields were added.
#
#	4.1		The kPhonetic data was regenerated to include multiple entries for individual
#			characters.  Duplicate entries were removed from the kMandarin and kCantonese
#			fields.  All fields are now complete.  The kFenn field had substantial new 
#			data added.  The kFennIndex field was added. The latest data sets for kSBGY 
#			and kHanYu were included.  The kAlternateKangXi and kAlternateMorohashi 
#			fields were dropped.  The syntax of the kSemanticVariant and 
#			kSpecializedSemanticVariant fields was extended to include source information.
#			The data in these two fields were substantially extended. The Cantonese field
#			has been changed to use jyutping instead of Yale romanization.  Preliminary
#			data for new characters has been added.  The various kIRG* fields have
#			had their values resynchronized with data in ISO/IEC 10646.  Numerous other 
#			individual corrections and additions were made.  The header has been
#			restructured and expanded, in preparation for moving the field
#			descriptions into a separate document.  The kRSAdobe_Japan1_6 field was
#			added.  The Cantonese readings have been extended and corrected using
#			data from the Hong Kong Linguistic Society and Hong Kong Polytechnic
#			University.	The kIICore field was added.
#
#	4.0.1	In addition to numerous small changes and corrections, the kMandarin field
#			has been regenerated from earlier versions of the data with later corrections
#			re-inserted.  This was required because of a script error which incorrectly
#			assigned readings to various characters.  The order of the kMandarin field
#			has been restored to frequency order.  There have been substantial updates
#			and corrections to the kCantonese, kCihaiT, kCowles, kDefinition, kGradeLevel, 
#			kHKGlyph, kLau, kMeyerWempe, and kVietnamese fields.  (The kCihaiT, kCowles, 
#			kGradeLevel, and kLau fields are now complete.)  The kHanyuPinlu, kIRG_USource,
#			and kGSR fields have been added.  
#
#	KNOWN ERRORS:
#
#	The Japanese and Korean readings need to be normalized.  The variant fields need
#		to be extended.
