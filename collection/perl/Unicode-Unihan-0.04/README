NAME
    Unicode::Unihan - The Unihan Data Base 5.1.0

SYNOPSIS
      use Unicode::Unihan;
      my $uh = Unicode::Unihan->new;
      print join("," => $uh->Mandarin("\x{5c0f}\x{98fc}\x{5f3e}")), "\n";

ABSTRACT
    This module provides a user-friendly interface to the Unicode Unihan
    Database 5.1. With this module, the Unihan database is as easy as shown
    in the SYNOPSIS above.

DESCRIPTION
    The first thing you do is make the database available. Just say

      use Unicode::Unihan;
      my $uh = new Unicode::Unihan;

    That's all you have to say. After that, you can access the database via
    $uh->*tag*($string) where *tag* is the tag in the Unihan Database,
    without 'k' prefix.

    $data = $uh->*tag*($string)
    @data = $uh->*tag*($string)
      The first form (scalar context) returns the Unihan Database entry of
      the first character in $string. The second form (array context) checks
      the entry for each character in $string.

        @data = $uh->Mandarin("\x{5c0f}\x{98fc}\x{5f3e}");
        # @data is now ('SHAO4 XIAO3','SI4','DAN4')

        @data = $uh->JapaneseKun("\x{5c0f}\x{98fc}\x{5f3e}");
        # @data is now ('CHIISAI KO O','KAU YASHINAU','TAMA HAZUMU HIKU')
